# School_Analysis
Purpose of the Analysis:

The project aims at analysing and gathering information about 15 different schools. The analysis focused on the overall passing, math and reading percentages from different schools to prepare for a board meeting. After the board reviewed the data, it was discovered that the 9th grade class of Thomas High School was accused of academic dishonesty. The board requested for the 9th grade data be removed and re-analyzed.

Results:
* How is the district summary affected?
 
 The percentages of passing math (i.e. from 75	to 74.8), passing reading (i.e. from 86 to 85.7) and overall passing (i.e. from 65 to 64.9) of the adjusted analysis had less than a 1% difference from the original analysis.
